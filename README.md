# Professional-Portfolio
For my portfolio I utilized HTML and CSS to create a web page that consists of the following parts, my name, sections that consist of about me, my work, my resume, and my contact information. The UI allows a user to click a navigation link and be brought to the corresponding section. I did this through using hyperlinks with corresponding ids in each section. Each of my projects that I have worked are user friendly and when clicked, the user will be brought to each page accordingly. This was done by creating hyperlinks with images nestled into them. I used my contact information as the footer for the page. The HTML and CSS all have descriptions and syntax for each section to allow anyone working or looking at the project to have a clear understanding of where they are and what they are looking at. Through the use of media quieries the page can be resized and the text inside will adjust. Also, with media quieries the page can be accessed on smaller screens and adjust for the user.
